    A croissant is a buttery, flaky, crescent-shaped pastry. The name comes from the French word croissant, which means
  "crescent" or "crescent of the moon". 
  The croissant's origins are in Austria, where it was called a kipferl.
  Two Austrian bakers brought the kipferl to France in the 19th century.
  French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with yeast-leavened dough in the early 20th century.  
  Ingredients: Butter or margarine and Yeast-leavened dough. 
  Croissants are often eaten for breakfast or as a snack
  They pair well with coffee.
